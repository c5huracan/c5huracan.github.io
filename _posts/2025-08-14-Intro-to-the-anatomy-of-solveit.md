# Intro to the Anatomy of solveit

**User:** Can you expand on your tool use capabilities?

**solveit:** I have two main tool capabilities:

**1. Web Search** - I can search for current information online, which is helpful for:
- Finding up-to-date information about rapidly changing topics (like AI tools, recent developments)
- Looking up specific facts or current events
- Researching topics beyond my training data

**2. Read URL** - I can fetch and read content from web pages, which lets me:
- Access specific documentation, articles, or repositories
- Analyze content from URLs you provide
- Get real-time information from web sources

These tools are particularly useful for staying current with fast-moving fields like the agentic AI and software development topics we've been discussing.

**User:** What about your agentic behaviors?

**solveit:** That's an interesting question! I can exhibit some agentic behaviors, but I'm not a fully autonomous agent like the development tools we were discussing.

**What I can do that's "agentic":**
- Use tools (web search, URL reading) to gather information when needed
- Break down complex problems into steps
- Adapt my responses based on context and your expertise level
- Guide learning processes by asking clarifying questions

**What I can't do (yet):**
- Persist across sessions or maintain long-term memory
- Execute code directly in external environments
- Make autonomous decisions without your input
- Modify files or systems independently

I'm more of an "interactive assistant" than a fully autonomous agent. I can help you explore agentic concepts and work with agentic tools, but I operate within a conversational framework.

**User:** What about your advanced reasoning capabilties?

**solveit:** That's a great question! My reasoning capabilities include several key areas:

**What I can do:**
- **Multi-step problem solving** - Break complex problems into logical steps and work through them systematically
- **Contextual reasoning** - Connect information across our conversation and draw relevant conclusions
- **Analytical thinking** - Compare options, identify patterns, and evaluate trade-offs (like we did with the coding agents)
- **Adaptive reasoning** - Adjust my approach based on your expertise level and learning goals

**Where I shine:**
- Connecting concepts across domains (like how we linked code generation to general task automation)
- Synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Asking clarifying questions to better understand your needs

**Limitations:**
- I reason within our conversation context, but don't maintain long-term learning
- My reasoning is bounded by the information available to me
- I can't execute reasoning that requires real-world interaction beyond my tools

**User:** What about your design and architecture?

**solveit:** I'm built on Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet model and created by fast.ai as "solveit" - an AI assistant designed for interactive learning and problem-solving.

**Key architectural elements:**
- **Dialog Engineering environment** - I work within a persistent context where you can create code, note, and prompt messages
- **Tool integration** - I can use web search and URL reading tools when needed
- **Persistent Python interpreter** - You have access to Python 3.11 with libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
- **Interactive design** - I'm built to work in small chunks, encouraging back-and-forth rather than long monologues

**Design philosophy:**
- Focus on learning through exploration rather than just providing answers
- Encourage you to do the work yourself unless you explicitly ask me to do it
- Adapt to your expertise level and interests

The architecture is designed around collaborative problem-solving rather than autonomous operation - I'm more of a thinking partner than an independent agent.

# Building a Knowledge Flow Optimizer: Part I - From Idea to Working MVP

Ever notice how information gets siloed in teams? Documents scattered across drives, valuable insights buried in emails, and knowledge trapped in individual team members' heads. It's a problem that plagues even high-performance teams. So I decided to build a solution - a Knowledge Flow Optimizer that uses AI to connect related information across documents.

## The Vision

I wanted to create something revolutionary in its simplicity. Not another bloated enterprise system, but a tool that actually solves the problem of disconnected knowledge. Why? Because I'm tired of seeing brilliant ideas die in isolation.

What I envisioned was a system that could:
* Discover hidden connections between documents based on meaning, not just keywords
* Surface relevant information that would otherwise remain buried
* Connect dots that humans might miss entirely

Most solutions in this space are overengineered behemoths requiring complex infrastructure and months of development. I wanted something I could build and deploy in days, not months.

## The Tech Stack Debate

The tech industry loves complexity. We're constantly told we need microservices, Kubernetes clusters, and distributed systems for even the simplest applications. It's nonsense.

I initially considered the "proper" enterprise stack:
* FastAPI for the backend
* React with TypeScript for the frontend
* Vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate
* Multiple microservices for different components

But why? For an MVP, simplicity is key. I settled on FastHTML, SQLite via Fastlite, and Sentence-Transformers. No fancy infrastructure, no complex deployment pipelines. Just code that works.

## The Core Components

The system works through four interconnected processes that transform raw documents into a web of connected knowledge. The document upload provides the raw material. The text chunking breaks it down into digestible pieces. The embedding generation translates human language into mathematical vectors. And the similarity search - this is where the magic happens - connects ideas across document boundaries.

By comparing document embeddings, we can find connections that keyword matching would miss. A document about "team communication guidelines" might be semantically related to one about "project management best practices" even if they share few keywords. That's the power of modern AI - it understands concepts, not just words.

## The Development Journey

Building this wasn't without challenges. The path was littered with unexpected obstacles:
* Response handling quirks in FastHTML that resulted in blank pages
* Document chunking that initially broke under certain conditions
* Embedding generation that needed careful optimization

But by systematically isolating each component and testing it individually, I built a working MVP. The key was starting simple and gradually adding complexity - exactly the opposite of how most enterprise software is developed.

## The Result

The current MVP isn't going to win any design awards. It's functional, not beautiful. But it works, and it delivers on the core promise: helping information flow between otherwise disconnected documents.

Users can now:
* Upload text documents from anywhere
* View document content in a simple interface
* Discover semantically related documents with similarity scores
* Navigate this web of knowledge with a few clicks

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. The foundation is solid, but there's much more to build. Is a tool like this actually valuable, or just another tech solution in search of a problem? I believe it's the former, but I'm eager to find out.

In Part II, we'll take this MVP to the next level. Not by adding unnecessary features, but by enhancing what already works. The question remains: can technology solve what is fundamentally a human problem? Or are information silos inevitable regardless of our tools?

What do you think? Would you rather have another slick dashboard that promises the world, or a simple tool that actually helps you discover connections you'd otherwise miss?

Stay tuned for Part II.

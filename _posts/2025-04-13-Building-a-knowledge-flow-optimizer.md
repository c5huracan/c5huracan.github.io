# Building a Knowledge Flow Optimizer: Part I - From Idea to Working MVP

Information silos are a common challenge in organizations of all sizes. Documents live in different systems, insights get buried in emails, and valuable knowledge often remains confined to individual team members. Even high-performance teams struggle with this problem. That's why I decided to explore building a Knowledge Flow Optimizer that uses AI to connect related information across documents.

## The Vision

I wanted to create something practical yet innovative - a tool that addresses the real problem of disconnected knowledge without unnecessary complexity. The goal was to build something that could demonstrate value quickly.

What I envisioned was a system that could:
* Identify meaningful connections between documents based on semantic understanding
* Surface relevant information that might otherwise be overlooked
* Reveal relationships between concepts across different documents

Many existing solutions in this space require significant investment in infrastructure and development time. I was interested in creating something lightweight that could be built and deployed rapidly to test the concept.

## The Tech Stack Debate

The tech industry offers powerful solutions for complex problems. Enterprise-grade technologies like microservices, Kubernetes clusters, and distributed systems have their place in large-scale applications. But sometimes we reach for these tools out of habit rather than necessity.

I initially considered the full enterprise stack:
* FastAPI for the backend
* React with TypeScript for the frontend
* Vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate
* Multiple microservices for different components

For an established product with thousands of users, this might be appropriate. But for an MVP? Simplicity is key. Spoiler alert: I landed on FastHTML, SQLite via Fastlite, and Sentence-Transformers. A lightweight stack that let me focus on proving the concept before scaling up.

* Vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate
* Multiple microservices for different components

For an established product with thousands of users, this might be appropriate. But for an MVP? Simplicity is key. Spoiler alert: I landed on FastHTML, SQLite via Fastlite for data storage (yes, even for vector embeddings!), and Sentence-Transformers. A lightweight stack that let me focus on proving the concept before scaling up.

The choice to use SQLite for storing vector embeddings might raise some eyebrows. While specialized vector databases would be necessary for production scale, SQLite proved sufficient for proving the concept. By storing the embeddings as JSON strings in SQLite, I avoided an entire category of infrastructure complexity while still getting good enough performance for initial testing. This approach won't scale to thousands of documents, but it perfectly serves the MVP purpose of demonstrating value before investing in more complex infrastructure.

## The Core Components

The system works through four interconnected processes that transform raw documents into a web of connected knowledge. The document upload provides the raw material. The text chunking breaks it down into digestible pieces. The embedding generation translates human language into mathematical vectors. And the similarity search - this is where the magic happens - connects ideas across document boundaries.

By comparing document embeddings, we can find connections that keyword matching would miss. A document about "team communication guidelines" might be semantically related to one about "project management best practices" even if they share few keywords. That's the power of modern AI - it understands concepts, not just words.

## The Development Journey

Building this wasn't without challenges. The path was littered with unexpected obstacles:
* Response handling quirks in FastHTML that resulted in blank pages
* Document chunking that initially broke under certain conditions
* Embedding generation that needed careful optimization

But by systematically isolating each component and testing it individually, I built a working MVP. The key was starting simple and gradually adding complexity - exactly the opposite of how most enterprise software is developed.

## The Result

The current MVP isn't going to win any design awards. It's functional, not beautiful. But it works, and it delivers on the core promise: helping information flow between otherwise disconnected documents.

Users can now:
* Upload text documents from anywhere
* View document content in a simple interface
* Discover semantically related documents with similarity scores
* Navigate this web of knowledge with a few clicks

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. The foundation is solid, but there's much more to build. Is a tool like this actually valuable, or just another tech solution in search of a problem? I believe it's the former, but I'm eager to find out.

In Part II, we'll take this MVP to the next level. Not by adding unnecessary features, but by enhancing what already works. The question remains: can technology solve what is fundamentally a human problem? Or are information silos inevitable regardless of our tools?

What do you think? Would you rather have another slick dashboard that promises the world, or a simple tool that actually helps you discover connections you'd otherwise miss?

Stay tuned for Part II.
